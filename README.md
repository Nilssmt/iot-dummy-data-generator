# 📡 IoT Blockchain Prototype

This is a two-part prototype developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis titled:
**"Analyzing the Potential of Blockchain Technology in Smart Buildings"**.

It demonstrates how decentralized technologies such as smart contracts and MQTT-based IoT data streams can be combined to enable secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data handling in modern building automation systems.

## 🔗 Project Structure

This prototype consists of two repositories:

### 1. [`iot-dummy-data-generator`](https://github.com/your-username/iot-dummy-data-generator)
A Python-based script that simulates IoT sensor data (e.g. temperature, humidity) and sends it to a blockchain interface via MQTT.

- Built with: Python, paho-mqtt, random data simulation
- Use case: Simulating realistic sensor behavior and thresholds

### 2. [`iot-blockchain-prototype`](https://github.com/your-username/iot-blockchain-prototype)
A decentralized application (dApp) that stores incoming IoT data on the Ethereum (Base )blockchain and displays them in a React-based dashboard.

- Built with: Solidity, Web3.js, React, MQTT.js
- Network: Ethereum (Base Testnet via Infura)

---

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ IoT data simulation with configurable thresholds and randomization
- ✅ Real-time communication using MQTT protocol
- ✅ Smart Contract for decentralized and gas-optimized data storage
- ✅ Web dashboard for live data monitoring
